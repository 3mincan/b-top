      <p>Hi! This is Project B-TOP! (Bring Together Online Presence)</p>
      <p>
        We all fill too many forms and profiles. So who wants to write another
        content?
      </p>
      <p>
        Lol! Maybe you, not me. This project are full of APIs. Here they are:
      </p>
      <p>Splashbase Api (for Site Background)</p>
      <p>Github Api (on Home Page)</p>
      <p>dev.to api (on Articles Page)</p>
      <p>formspree.io api(on Contact Page)</p>
      <p>And this is the content that I couldn't decide where should I put:</p>
      <Stackoverflow id="1144035" />
      <Footer />
    </>
  );
};
